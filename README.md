# Effects of Race and Education on Voting Behavior

## Overview

Data from the 2020 Cooperative Election Study was used to create a model that predicts whether a person voted for Trump or Biden in the 2020 Election based on their
race and education. The analysis suggests higher levels of education and being part of certain racial groups, namely Black and Asian, are correlated with a greater likelihood of voting for Biden. This research can allow policymakers better cater to their base and help individuals to better understand the relationship between socioeconomic factors and politics.
